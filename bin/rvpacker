rvpacker packs and unpacks binary RPG Maker project data to and from YAML so
that it can be version-controlled and collaborated on.

Usage:
        rvpacker {--pack|--unpack} [options]

Options:
EOS

  # NOTE: The `--action` option is deprecated and will likely be removed in the
  #   future.

  opt :project_type, 'Project type (xp|vx|ace)', short: 't', type: String
  opt :database, 'Only work on the given database', short: 'D', type: String
  opt :force, 'Update target even when source is older than target'
  opt :verbose, 'Print verbose information while processing', short: 'V'
